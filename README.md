# Iris Flower Classification Workshop

This repository contains a series of notebooks demonstrating different machine learning approaches to the Iris Flower dataset. Below are the notebooks with their respective focus areas.

## 1. Iris Flower Classification

This notebook focuses on classifying Iris flowers into different species using traditional machine learning algorithms.

## 2. Iris Flower Regression (Not Advisable)

This notebook attempts to apply regression models on the Iris flower dataset. It is not generally recommended due to the nature of the dataset (classification task rather than regression).

## 3. Iris Flower Deep Learning (Not Advisable)

This notebook demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques to model the Iris dataset. While deep learning may work for this problem, it's not an ideal approach due to the simplicity of the dataset and the nature of the task.
