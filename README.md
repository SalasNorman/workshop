# Iris Flower Classification Workshop

This repository contains a series of notebooks demonstrating different machine learning approaches to the Iris Flower dataset. Below are the notebooks with their respective focus areas.

## 1. Iris Flower Classification

This notebook demonstrates the classification of Iris flowers using various machine learning models and hyperparameter tuning. The models used are:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## 2. Iris Flower Regression (Not Advisable)

This notebook demonstrates the use of regression models applied to the Iris dataset. Though regression is not the ideal approach for this classification problem, the following models are implemented with hyperparameter tuning:

- **Linear Regression**: No hyperparameters for tuning, but cross-validation is performed.
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regression**
- **Random Forest Regression**

## 3. Iris Flower Deep Learning (Not Advisable)

This notebook demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques to model the Iris dataset. While deep learning may work for this problem, it's not an ideal approach due to the simplicity of the dataset and the nature of the task.
